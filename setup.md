# Raspberry Pi External Drive Setup

> *This guide and script were generated by ChatGPT to help configure and format an external hard drive on a headless Raspberry Pi.*

## 🔧 What It Does
- Prompts for the disk to use (e.g., /dev/sda)
- Creates a new GPT partition
- Formats it as ext4
- Mounts it at `/mnt/samsung` (or your choice)
- Sets permissions for all users
- Configures auto-mount at boot via `/etc/fstab`

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Copy `setup.sh` to your Raspberry Pi
2. Run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

⚠️ **Warning:** This will erase all data on the selected drive.

Happy hacking! 🐧💾
